## Plan
- Use the JSON file to define the scnario; track, ambient, power ups and obstacles.
- Create a class for the track, ambient, power ups and obstacles which will be call by the parser so we have to extend the YASF definition and update the parser.
- Create a class for the ballon, in the constructor we will pass the texture and the track.
